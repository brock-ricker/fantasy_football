Data Wrangling
---

This project uses data from 2 main sources:
* APIs from [myfantasyleague.com](https://api.myfantasyleague.com/2022/api_info) for fantasy football data
* Web scraping from https://www.sportsoddshistory.com/ for historical scores, spreads and over/unders

This data is collected, cleaned, and saved to SQL server for analysis. To setup a similar database, you can use: Fantasy_Football_Server_Initialization_v*. This script will setup an SQLite server and populate it from the above sources. Please note: The API requests are spaced out in order to prevent being locked out by myfantasyleague, because of this the script will take ~30 minutes to run.

The list of tables generated by the script are as follows:

| Table Name | Description | Source |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| weekly_players | Weekly results, broken down by players | https://api.myfantasyleague.com/2022/api_info |
