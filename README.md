* Web scraping from https://www.sportsoddshistory.com/ for historical scores, spreads and over/unders

This data is collected, cleaned, and saved to SQL server for analysis. To setup a similar database, you can use: Fantasy_Football_Server_Initialization_v*. This script will setup an SQLite server and populate it from the above sources. The list of tables generated by the script are as follows:
